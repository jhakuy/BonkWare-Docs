# BonkWare Documentation

## 1. Introduction

BonkWare is a community-driven AI evolution platform that combines governance, gaming, and autonomous development. Our platform enables community members to propose, vote on, and implement new features through a decentralized governance system powered by Solana blockchain technology.

### Key Goals and Audience
- **Community-First Development**: Enable token holders to directly influence platform evolution
- **Transparent Governance**: On-chain voting through Council of Architects NFT holders
- **Gamified Experience**: Engaging mini-games and narrative elements
- **Autonomous Execution**: AI-driven implementation of approved proposals

**Target Audience**: Crypto enthusiasts, gamers, developers, and community governance advocates

## 2. Platform Architecture

### 2.1 Suggestion & Governance Flow

The BonkWare governance system follows a structured flow:

```
Draft → Review → Council Proposal → Implementation Queue
```

**Process Overview:**
- **Draft Phase**: Community members submit suggestions and ideas
- **Review Phase**: Initial community feedback and refinement
- **Council Proposal**: Formal proposal submitted to Council of Architects
- **Implementation Queue**: Approved proposals enter development pipeline

#### Council of Architects (100 Seat NFTs)
- **100 NFT Seats**: Limited governance positions with voting rights
- **Voting Power**: Each NFT represents one vote in governance decisions
- **Requirements**: Stake-to-Submit mechanics ensure quality proposals
- **Platform**: On-chain voting via Solana Realms

### 2.2 Autonomous Execution Engine (Spec Only)

> **Note:** We are *not* building the AI here—just documenting how it *would* tie together once implemented.

**Component Architecture:**
- **Suggestion Ingestor**: Processes and categorizes community proposals
- **Spec Generator**: Uses Claude Sonnet to create technical specifications
- **Eliza OS Sandbox**: Safe testing environment with CI pipeline
- **Multisig Deployment Agent**: Secure deployment mechanism
- **Monitoring & Rollback**: Continuous monitoring with automatic rollback capabilities
